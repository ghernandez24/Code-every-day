### Day 4: April 9, 2021

#### Todays Progress:
- Read up on more documetation of Google Firebase and authentication. Connected the front end to friebase db. 

#### Thoughts: 
- There's alot of reading. THe open source formatting is wrong as they put the API key in the component and we all know that they should not do that.
